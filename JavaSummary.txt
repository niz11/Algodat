Let's say you wanted to use a few

different classes from the java.util package: ArrayList and TreeSet. You can

add a wildcard character (*) to your import statement that means, "If you see a

reference to a class you're not sure of, you can look through the entire package for

that class," like so:

import java.util.*;

public class MyClass {

public static void main(String[] args) {

ArrayList<String> a = new ArrayList<String>();

TreeSet<String> t = new TreeSet<String>();

}

}
